## Overview

The Next-Gen Audio Translator is designed to offer a seamless experience for users who need to convert audio content across languages. Key functionalities include:

- **Audio Transcription:** Uses a Whisper-based model (`whisper-large-v3`) to transcribe input audio.
- **Language Detection:** Automatically detects and displays the source language.
- **Translation:** Leverages the Groq API with the `gemma2-9b-it` model to translate text, preserving meaning and cultural nuances.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts the translated text back into audio using dedicated TTS models (with support for language-specific voices).
- **Modern UI:** Features an interactive Gradio interface with customizable themes, responsive design, and history tracking.
- **Real-time Processing:** Option for real-time transcription and translation with an animated loading indicator.
